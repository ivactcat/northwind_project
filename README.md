# Data analytic northwind_project
This SQL Data Analysis project using the Northwind Database focuses on performing data analysis to extract information related to sales, products, customers, and employees within a distribution company. The main goal of this project is to explore the database and create SQL queries that provide valuable insights into sales performance, product behavior, customer activity, and employee effectiveness.

# Project Description
The project involves creating a series of SQL queries to extract key metrics and detailed insights about the companyâ€™s sales, products, customers, and employees. Some of the metrics analyzed include:

-	The most sold products by quantity and total sales value.
-	Customers who make the most purchases, either by quantity or total value.
-	Product categories with the highest sales volume.
-	Recurring customers, high-revenue clients, and clients who haven't made recent purchases.
-	Sales analysis across different periods (annually, quarterly, monthly).
-	Employee performance, such as those managing the most orders or generating the highest sales.
-	Seasonal trends and purchasing patterns over time.
  
The queries developed help in understanding how the company is performing in terms of sales, product management, inventory, and customer service.
