# Data analytic northwind_project
This SQL Data Analysis project using the Northwind Database focuses on performing data analysis to extract information related to sales, products, customers, and employees within a distribution company. The main goal of this project is to explore the database and create SQL queries that provide valuable insights into sales performance, product behavior, customer activity, and employee effectiveness.

# Project Description
The project involves creating a series of SQL queries to extract key metrics and detailed insights about the company’s sales, products, customers, and employees. Some of the metrics analyzed include:

-	The most sold products by quantity and total sales value.
-	Customers who make the most purchases, either by quantity or total value.
-	Product categories with the highest sales volume.
-	Recurring customers, high-revenue clients, and clients who haven't made recent purchases.
-	Sales analysis across different periods (annually, quarterly, monthly).
-	Employee performance, such as those managing the most orders or generating the highest sales.
-	Seasonal trends and purchasing patterns over time.
  
The queries developed help in understanding how the company is performing in terms of sales, product management, inventory, and customer service.

# SQL Queries Executed
The project contains a series of SQL queries organized into different categories, including:
# Sales Queries:
-	Sales by product.
-	Sales by category.
-	Sales by customer.
-	Sales by employee.
-Sales by time period (year, quarter, month).
# Customer Queries:
•	Customers with the highest purchases by quantity or value.
•	Recurring customers.
•	Customers with no recent purchases.
•	Customers generating the highest revenue.
# Product Queries:
•	Most sold products.
•	Products with the highest profitability.
•	Products at risk of running out of stock.
# Employee Queries:
•	Employees managing the most orders.
•	Employees generating the highest sales.
•	Employees with the best customer service history.
# Inventory Queries:
•	Products with the highest or lowest stock levels.
•	Analysis of high-demand products with low stock.

These queries allow for the generation of detailed reports on the company’s operations and are useful for analysts and managers to assess business performance.

# Conclusion
The SQL Analysis Project using the Northwind Database offers a deep understanding of sales, products, customers, and employees within a distribution company. The SQL queries enable the extraction of key metrics and sales patterns, help identify business opportunities, and optimize inventory and customer relationship management. This analysis provides a solid foundation for informed decision-making and improves operational efficiency, making it a useful tool for developers, analysts, and managers.
